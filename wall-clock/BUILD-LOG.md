# Wall Clock — Build Log

Append-only. Newest entry at the bottom. Every session working on this project adds a
dated entry: what was decided, *why*, and what the next open question is. If you are
picking this up cold, read the last entry first, then `docs/`.

Provenance follows the second-brain convention: facts are tagged **(verified)** — a
primary source was read — or **(assumed)** — plausible but unconfirmed. Never build on
an assumed fact as if it were confirmed.

## 2026-08-21 — Project opened

Goal: replace the Amazon Echo Wall Clock. It did two things — showed the time, and lit
a 60-LED ring to visualise voice timers. Rebuild both on Home Assistant, and add the
ambient status the Echo could never do.

**Priority order when something has to give: reliable clock > timers > status.**
This ordering is the tiebreaker for every design decision that follows. The clock must
survive Home Assistant being down; the timer and status features may not.

### Environment (given by Samuel, treated as fact, not re-derived)

- Home Assistant OS at `192.168.1.79:8123`, Core 2026.8.2, admin user Vultron
- ESPHome Device Builder add-on + Mosquitto MQTT installed
- YAML packages enabled: `/config/packages/*.yaml` via `packages: !include_dir_named packages`
- Frigate 0.17.2 on a Pi 5 at `192.168.1.63` — 6 cameras, face + plate recognition.
  Entities: `sensor.next_bin` (state `Green waste`/`Recycling`, attr `next_bin_night`),
  `sensor.vehicle_plate_log`, `sensor.<name>_last_seen` for Sam, Laura, Amanda, Zac
- HA Voice PE satellites on order: Kitchen, Living, Bedroom, Garage
- Location: Victoria, Australia — DST applies, prices AUD, buys from AliExpress /
  Core Electronics / Zaitronics
- Tools on hand: 2x Bambu Lab printers, Glowforge Aura laser, 3x spare Pi 4B,
  2x spare Intel NUC, 1x unused WLED LED matrix

### Constraint noted up front

This session runs in a cloud container with no route to `192.168.1.0/24`. It cannot
reach Home Assistant, cannot run `ha core check`, and cannot flash a device. Anything
requiring those is written out precisely for Samuel to run, and marked as **not yet
verified on real hardware** until he reports back.

### Next

Phase 1 research: how Assist timer state is actually exposed in HA 2026.8, and whether
a separate ESPHome device can subscribe to it. That answer determines the whole design,
so it gets verified against primary sources and then adversarially re-checked before
anything is built on it.

---

## 2026-08-21 — Phase 1 research complete

Full ledger: [docs/PHASE-1-RESEARCH.md](docs/PHASE-1-RESEARCH.md). Headlines:

**The crux question has a clean answer, and it is not the obvious one.** Assist timers really are a
closed subsystem — no entities, no bus events, dispatch hard-keyed to the `device_id` of the device
that set the timer, and the ESP32 firmware itself refuses a second subscriber. A separate ESP32
cannot listen. That part is verified at HA Core tag 2026.8.2 and is final.

But the right move is to **never let the timer enter `TimerManager`**. `intent_script:` can override
`HassStartTimer`, routing a spoken timer into a real `timer.*` helper entity — real state, real bus
events, an absolute `finishes_at`, and **no firmware change on the Voice PE**, so it keeps its OTA
updates. Verified by source; **not yet bench-tested**.

**Process note worth remembering:** the first three research passes all concluded "closed, therefore
reflash the Voice PE", and all three explicitly warned away from the `timer` helper as a dead end.
Three independent agents, same wrong answer — because they all grepped the same way and missed the
same file. Only the adversarial pass, told to *refute* rather than confirm, opened
`intent/__init__.py` and found `/api/intent/handle` and the override mechanism. Convergence is not
confirmation. Keep the refutation step in later phases.

### Decisions taken (subject to Sam's sign-off)

- **Timer path:** `intent_script` override → `timer.<area>` helper → ESPHome `text_sensor` importing
  `attribute: finishes_at`, counted down locally. Fallbacks ranked in the ledger.
  *Revert:* delete the `HassStartTimer:` block from `intent_script:` and HA's built-in handler
  re-registers on restart. Nothing else to undo.
- **Base project:** port `markusressel/ESPHome-Analog-Clock` (CC0, 60-LED, real CI compile) from
  ESP8266/neopixelbus to ESP32/`esp32_rmt_led_strip`. Steal the timer arc from the Voice PE firmware.
- **LED component:** `esp32_rmt_led_strip`. Not a preference — `neopixelbus` and `fastled` *fail
  config validation* under the default `esp-idf` framework.

### Corrections to the brief

- **3.6 A is a worst case, not a spec.** The original WS2812B datasheet has no current figure at all;
  the current V5 part specifies 36 mA/LED. Realistic full white on 60 LEDs is ~2.4 A. Still size for
  60 mA/LED, because sellers don't state the revision.
- **`api: password:` removal in ESPHome 2026.1.0 — confirmed correct.**
- **Level shifter: yes, buy one.** ESP32 guarantees `VOH` = 2.64 V; the original WS2812B wants 3.5 V
  and even the relaxed V5 wants 2.7 V. Out of spec against both. It usually works on the bench and
  that is exactly the failure mode to avoid in a wall-mounted device.

### Landmine flagged

Draft PR `home-assistant/core#174847` adds a `timer_list` entity domain with real triggers and
websocket APIs — the three things missing today. Still Draft, not shipped. It **will require devices
to have a `timer_list` entity to support voice timers**. Building on `timer.*` helpers now is the
cleanest thing to swap over later.

### Next

Blocked on Sam: which WLED matrix he owns (16x16 has *exactly* 60 perimeter pixels and could make
this free), whether the Voice PE must stay stock (the override silences its own ring and chime), and
whether he has spare WS2812B strip from the xLights rig. Then Phase 2 BOM. **Nothing bought yet.**

---

## 2026-08-21 — Decisions locked, Phase 2 BOM ready

Full BOM: [docs/PHASE-2-BOM.md](docs/PHASE-2-BOM.md). **Nothing ordered — waiting on approval.**

### Sam's answers

- **Ring size:** initially 258 mm from 74 LEDs/m strip; **then changed to a one-piece 60-LED
  WS2812B ring, 172 mm OD.** The ring supersedes the strip plan.
- **Voice PE:** accept the `intent_script` override and let the Voice PE's own ring and chime go
  dark. The wall clock is the visual; `assist_satellite.announce` covers audio. Voice PE stays stock
  and keeps OTA.
- **Printers:** P1S and X2D.
- **WLED matrix:** size unknown — dropped from the plan. A strip offcut will be the bench rig instead.

### Why the ring beat the strip, in hindsight

The strip plan was sound but the ring is simply better here. Recording the analysis because it was
non-obvious and shouldn't be re-derived:

Flat WS2812B strip **cannot bend sideways in its own plane** — it only curls perpendicular to the
PCB. So a viewer-facing flat circle needs the strip cut into pieces. Cutting all 60 into singles is
60 joints / 180 wire ends. But approximating the circle as a **12-sided polygon of 5-LED segments**
costs only 12 joints and lands every LED within **0.118° of the ideal 6° dial grid** — 1.2 seconds of
dial, invisible. That was going to be the plan.

The ring removes it entirely: no cuts, no joints, LEDs already facing the viewer, and at 172 mm the
enclosure body (~196 mm) **prints in one piece** on a 256 mm bed instead of four arcs. Smaller clock,
far less risk.

*(Kept for reference: the 12-segment maths is reusable if a bigger clock is ever wanted. Diameter is
locked to strip density — 60/m → 320 mm, 74/m → 261 mm, 96/m → 200 mm, 144/m → 133 mm — because the
LED pitch must subtend 6°, which fixes the radius-to-pitch ratio.)*

### Two findings that changed the plan

**The Glowforge Aura cannot cut the diffuser.** It is a ~5 W **diode** laser, not CO₂, and clear,
white and translucent acrylic are largely transparent to its wavelength. Glowforge's own Aura material
set is opaque acrylic only. Since a diffuser is white/translucent *by definition*, the split becomes:
**Aura → 3 mm plywood** for the face and engraved markers; **Bambu → white PLA** for the diffuser,
printed thin with 60 individual light wells. That's a better diffuser than flat acrylic anyway.
*(Sam's PVC/chlorine warning stands and is correct — nothing in the BOM is PVC.)*

**The MCU recommendation inverted on availability, not merit.** Plain ESP32 is the *better* RMT host
(8 TX channels / 512 symbols vs the S3's 4 / 192). But Core Electronics no longer stocks a cheap
WROOM-32 devkit, so plain ESP32 is now effectively AliExpress-only in AU. The S3 Mini (`WS-27070`,
$9.85, in stock) wins on availability alone. **If there's a spare ESP32 in the xLights box, use that
instead** — it's technically preferable and free.

### Corrections carried forward

- **`max_power` cannot cap an addressable strip in ESPHome** — float-outputs-only. The brightness cap
  must be enforced inside the lambda. Phase 3 must not assume otherwise.
- **A 4 A supply covers the absolute worst case (3.78 A)**, which makes the brightness cap a comfort
  setting rather than a safety mechanism. That is the right way round — a firmware bug should not
  become an electrical problem.
- **GC9A01 rejected:** 11.9 mm digits are legible to ~1.4 m; a kitchen glance is 3–5 m. Also costs a
  ~100 ms main-loop stall every second, which would visibly stutter the ring.

### Next

**Stop. Waiting on Sam to approve the BOM before anything is ordered.** Then Phase 3 firmware —
which can start on a strip offcut before the ring arrives.
